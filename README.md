# Healthcare Data Analytics Project
*Analyzing Patient Data to Drive Healthcare Insights and Cost Optimization*

## 📊 Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end healthcare data analysis using Excel to uncover actionable insights around patient health outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. Through systematic data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization, I identified key patterns linking lifestyle factors to health outcomes and hospital costs.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Healthcare providers need data-driven insights to:
- Identify high-risk patient populations
- Optimize resource allocation across hospital tiers
- Reduce preventable healthcare costs
- Improve preventive care strategies

## 🔧 Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning & Validation:** Statistical methods (mean, median, mode), outlier detection
- **Feature Engineering:** Patient segmentation based on BMI and blood sugar classifications
- **Statistical Analysis:** Correlation analysis, trend identification, comparative analysis
- **Data Visualization:** Multi-chart dashboards (donut, column, line charts)
- **Tools:** Microsoft Excel (advanced formulas, pivot tables, conditional formatting)

## 📁 Dataset
- **Sources:** 3 healthcare datasets covering patient demographics, medical history, and billing
- **Key Variables:** BMI, blood sugar levels, smoking status, cancer history, hospital charges, age, surgical history
- **Sample Size:** 1,000+ patient records analyzed

## 🔬 Methodology & Process

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Integration
- **Data Sources:** Merged 3 separate healthcare datasets (demographics, medical records, billing)
- **Integration Method:** VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH functions to create unified patient records
- **Quality Check:** Verified data integrity across 1,000+ patient records

### Phase 2: Data Cleaning & Preparation
- **Missing Values:** Identified and handled missing data using statistical imputation (mean/median)
- **Outlier Detection:** Applied IQR method to identify anomalous hospital charges
- **Data Validation:** Removed duplicate records and standardized categorical variables
- **Standardization:** Normalized age groups, BMI ranges, and blood sugar classifications

### Phase 3: Feature Engineering
- **BMI Classification:** Categorized patients into Underweight/Normal/Overweight/Obese based on WHO standards
- **Diabetes Segmentation:** Created Normal (<100 mg/dL), Pre-Diabetic (100-125), Diabetic (>125) categories
- **Age Groups:** Segmented into 5 age brackets for trend analysis
- **Cost Buckets:** Grouped hospital charges into quartiles for comparative analysis

### Phase 4: Statistical Analysis
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated mean, median, mode, standard deviation for key health metrics
- **Correlation Analysis:** Examined relationships between BMI, blood sugar, smoking, and cancer history
- **Cross-Tabulation:** Built pivot tables to identify patterns across multiple variables
- **Trend Analysis:** Line charts to track age-based health metric changes

### Phase 5: Visualization & Dashboard Creation
- **Chart Types Used:**
  - Donut charts for categorical distributions (cancer risk factors)
  - Column charts for comparative analysis (hospital tier costs)
  - Line charts for age-based trends (BMI and blood sugar over time)
  - Scatter plots for correlation visualization
- **Dashboard Design:** Interactive filters for dynamic analysis by age, hospital tier, and health status

### Phase 6: Insight Generation & Recommendations
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identified key correlations and unexpected trends
- **Business Translation:** Converted statistical findings into actionable healthcare strategies
- **Evidence Validation:** Cross-referenced findings with medical research literature

## 🔍 Key Analytical Findings

### 1. Cancer Risk Factor Analysis
- **Finding:** Obesity showed stronger correlation with cancer history than smoking alone
- **Methodology:** Cross-tabulation analysis with donut chart visualization
- **Insight:** 68% of cancer patients with obesity/overweight status vs. 45% among smokers
- **Evidence-Based Connection:** Research links obesity to insulin resistance, increasing colon cancer risk

### 2. Diabetes & Surgical Outcomes
- **Finding:** Patients with uncontrolled blood sugar underwent 2+ surgeries at 3x higher rates
- **Segmentation:** Classified patients as Normal/Pre-Diabetic/Diabetic based on glucose levels
- **Impact:** Highlights need for better diabetes management protocols

### 3. Healthcare Cost Drivers
- **Primary Cost Factor:** Obesity contributed to 35% higher hospital charges, independent of blood sugar control
- **Age-Based Trend:** Sharp cost increase post-60 years (average 2.5x increase)
- **Regional Variance:** Tier 2 hospitals showed highest per-patient charges
- **Recommendation:** Preventive weight management programs could significantly reduce costs

### 4. Demographic Health Trends
- **Young Adult Obesity:** Unexpected BMI peaks in 25-35 age group signal emerging public health concern
- **Senior Health Patterns:** Post-60 population shows diverging trends (↑ blood sugar, ↓ BMI)
- **Tier 2 Cities:** Infrastructure gaps correlate with higher treatment costs

## 💡 Business Recommendations
1. **Preventive Care Focus:** Implement weight management programs targeting obesity-related disease prevention
2. **Resource Allocation:** Increase diabetes management resources in Tier 2 hospitals
3. **Young Adult Screening:** Early obesity intervention programs for 25-35 demographic
4. **Cost Optimization:** Preventive care investment could reduce surgical and long-term treatment costs

## 📈 Visualizations & Deliverables
