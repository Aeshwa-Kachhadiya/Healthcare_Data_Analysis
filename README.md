# Healthcare Data Analytics Project
*Analyzing Patient Data to Drive Healthcare Insights and Cost Optimization*

## 📊 Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end healthcare data analysis using Excel to uncover actionable insights around patient health outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. Through systematic data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization, I identified key patterns linking lifestyle factors to health outcomes and hospital costs.

**Target Role:** Health Data Analyst Internship | Summer 2026

## 🎯 Business Problem
Healthcare providers need data-driven insights to:
- Identify high-risk patient populations
- Optimize resource allocation across hospital tiers
- Reduce preventable healthcare costs
- Improve preventive care strategies

## 🔧 Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning & Validation:** Statistical methods (mean, median, mode), outlier detection
- **Feature Engineering:** Patient segmentation based on BMI and blood sugar classifications
- **Statistical Analysis:** Correlation analysis, trend identification, comparative analysis
- **Data Visualization:** Multi-chart dashboards (donut, column, line charts)
- **Tools:** Microsoft Excel (advanced formulas, pivot tables, conditional formatting)

## 📁 Dataset
- **Sources:** 3 healthcare datasets covering patient demographics, medical history, and billing
- **Key Variables:** BMI, blood sugar levels, smoking status, cancer history, hospital charges, age, surgical history

## 🔍 Key Analytical Findings

### 1. Cancer Risk Factor Analysis
- **Finding:** Obesity showed stronger correlation with cancer history than smoking alone
- **Methodology:** Cross-tabulation analysis with donut chart visualization
- **Insight:** 68% of cancer patients with obesity/overweight status vs. 45% among smokers
- **Evidence-Based Connection:** Research links obesity to insulin resistance, increasing colon cancer risk

### 2. Diabetes & Surgical Outcomes
- **Finding:** Patients with uncontrolled blood sugar underwent 2+ surgeries at 3x higher rates
- **Segmentation:** Classified patients as Normal/Pre-Diabetic/Diabetic based on glucose levels
- **Impact:** Highlights need for better diabetes management protocols

### 3. Healthcare Cost Drivers
- **Primary Cost Factor:** Obesity contributed to 35% higher hospital charges, independent of blood sugar control
- **Age-Based Trend:** Sharp cost increase post-60 years (average 2.5x increase)
- **Regional Variance:** Tier 2 hospitals showed highest per-patient charges
- **Recommendation:** Preventive weight management programs could significantly reduce costs

### 4. Demographic Health Trends
- **Young Adult Obesity:** Unexpected BMI peaks in 25-35 age group signal emerging public health concern
- **Senior Health Patterns:** Post-60 population shows diverging trends (↑ blood sugar, ↓ BMI)
- **Tier 2 Cities:** Infrastructure gaps correlate with higher treatment costs

## 💡 Business Recommendations
1. **Preventive Care Focus:** Implement weight management programs targeting obesity-related disease prevention
2. **Resource Allocation:** Increase diabetes management resources in Tier 2 hospitals
3. **Young Adult Screening:** Early obesity intervention programs for 25-35 demographic
4. **Cost Optimization:** Preventive care investment could reduce surgical and long-term treatment costs
